    <h1>LoanGuard — Loan Default Prediction</h1>
    <p>
      This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan applicant
      is likely to default. The system includes preprocessing, feature
      engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
    </p>

    <h2> Project Overview</h2>
    <p>LoanGuard is a machine learning–based credit risk assessment system designed to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a bank loan. The primary goal of the project is to help banking institutions proactively identify high-risk applicants so they can reduce losses, improve lending decisions, and offer safer credit products.
The model analyzes borrower-level financial, behavioral, and demographic features to classify each loan application as either “Default” or “Non-Default.”</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset used for this project contains a mix of numerical and categorical variables commonly used in real-world credit scoring systems.
Some of the key features include:
Loan Amount : total amount requested by the borrower
Interest Rate : percentage charged on the loan
Loan Term : duration of repayment
Annual Income : borrowers yearly income
Employment Length : years of employment
DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio) : financial stress indicator
Delinquency History : number of past late payments
Credit Accounts : open/closed accounts, revolving utilization
Home Ownership : rent, own, mortgage
Purpose of Loan : credit card, education, small business, etc.
Before model training, the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical values are encoded. Outliers are also addressed to prevent model bias.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Machine Learning Approach</h2>
    <p>LoanGuard follows a complete end-to-end ML pipeline:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Missing value treatment
Outlier detection
Categorical encoding (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
Feature Engineering
Creation of new financial ratios
Encoding of risk-related attributes
Handling imbalance using class weights or SMOTE
Model Training
Multiple models were tested:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost (performed the best)
Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision / Recall
F1 Score
ROC-AUC (most important for credit scoring)
Confusion Matrix</p>
